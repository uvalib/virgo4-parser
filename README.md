# Virgo4 Parser

This is the parser library for the Virgo4 Search Grammar. It is based on an Antlr
BNF specification, and the base implementation was autogenerated by the same tool. The package
contains the base parser generated by Antlr and a basic Solr-specific parser.

It includes a sample cmd that sends strings though the parser and produces output. This 
can be used as a template for creating new parsers for search pools.


### System Requirements
* GO version 1.12 or greater (mod required)

# Notes

To run the sample parser implentation, execute the following
`cd cmd
 go run main.go`
